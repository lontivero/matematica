Matematica.js
=============

Matematica.js (Mathematic in Spanish) is a simple functional programming language for solving mathematical problems.

Examples
--------
```
> 5
5

> x + 7
x + 7

> y = 2
Y = 2

> z = y * 4
z = 8

> p = cos(w) + sin(s)
p = cos(w) + sin(s)

> a = [x y z; p q r]
a = [x 2 8; cos(w) + sin(s) q r]

> a(x=3, s=pi/2)
[3 2 8; cos(w) q r]
```

Development
-----------
Matematica.js is developed by [Lucas Ontivero](http://geeks.ms/blogs/lontivero) ([@lontivero](http://twitter.com/lontivero)). You are welcome to contribute code. You can send code both as a patch or a GitHub pull request.

Note that Matematica.js is still very much work in progress.
